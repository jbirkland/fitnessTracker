# Unit 18 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

## Ojective
Create a workout tracker that implements a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
The idea is to help the consumer reach their fitness goals more quickly by tracking their workout progress.
When the initial app is loaded the user is requested to create a new workout. Once the button is clicked they can choose between resistance and a cardio workout. The app will add up there total stats for each day and display them in a duration and a pounds chart once the dashboard button is clicked.
